git fold is the successor to git stata

as a standalone cli, can pull the git-dirs from git config, so that
you can either pass it a single argument (e.g. ~/repos/*) or ommit
that argument and have it pick from git config, where you can
actually have multiple arguments (directory blobs.)

it's fold as in reduce, you give it a group of repos and it aggregates
them in someway:
* git fold status *
displays a 'short log' of each status
* git fold fetch [origin] *
gets the tip for each repo, and may display a status-like short log
afterwards
* git fold log *
actually mingles all the logs together so that you can see a
chronological list of activity across repos (very useful for an
organization e.g. what longstorm wants to be)

it should show a short/relative date and preferrably only the
committer's first name, though it can go back and fix names for whom
there needs to be a surname abbrev (e.g. Vic G) for disambiguation.
