i want to be able to experiment with different speedworking splits
(maybe short spans 3-4min all throughout could work better in
seamlessly welding the two tracks together?) and measure it through
number of commits over a week or two.

number of commits, though not perfect, is a decent indicator of being
focused, on top of my game and knowing what i'm doing, it's nice to
think of it as 'unit of work' done, accomplished, finished.

gotta do markov-chain like learning to optimize the work split for the
user gradually. also a gui slider e.g. 70
