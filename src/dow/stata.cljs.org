stata should ultimately be about more than just keeping track of
local changes across different work projects: it should be about
keeping track and coordinating remotes and how up to date they
currently are (also what branches etc they have) and this should apply
to the .gut repo status as well.

in this sense it should be a bit like what git-annex offers in terms
of coordinating who has what, but for discrete git repos instead of
big files (i.e. stata is not about coordinating which files each
computer/"repository" has, but which git projects (repositories) each
remote/computer/"repository" has, if that makes good sense.)

i should be able to open git stata config and say "here's a computer
of mine accessible over local network in this address, it's
potentially a remote for all my git projects" and from then on git
stata can help me see where (which of my computers) each of my
projects have been copied to, and easily fetch them from there (since
it already has the git remote addresses needed.)
